### Merging VCF files

## Introduction
Code for merging sets of VCF files to produce one result file in which sample lists have been combined.

Can handle multiple files (2-n, in theory), sample name overlaps and differing data shapes.

Input files must be sorted by genomic position and should cover the same genomic range, within chromosome.
